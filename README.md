# InTune Overview
InTune is a real time music note detection mobile/web application that provides users with an efficient and effective way to practice and compose music. The InTune application utilizes the internal microphone of the device it is run on to record live audio and then display each note in real time within the application. InTune can be used to tune instruments or match pitch by informing users if the note being played into the microphone is flat or sharp. InTune also allows users to upload sheet music so the application can compare it with the live input audio and provide users a visual representation of where within a song they are out of tune. This system is also a way for users to play or sing original pieces that are transcribed into sheet music in real time with the capability to edit and save. Users can connect with other users from separate devices to compose pieces together with the virtual band tool. InTune is a great way for users to get into the world of music.
