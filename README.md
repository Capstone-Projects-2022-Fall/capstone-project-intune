# InTune Overview
InTune is a real-time music note detection software-hardware system that provides users with an efficient and effective way to practice intonation. Musicians and singers alike can benefit from this product and improve their musical capabilities. </br>

A Raspberry Pi connected to a microphone is used as the audio input device which then uploads users live audio to the Intune application where the user can view each note they used. InTune can be used to tune instruments or match pitch by informing users if the note being played into the microphone is flat or sharp. InTune also allows users to upload sheet music so the application can compare it with the live input audio and provide users a visual representation of where within a song they are out of tune. This system is also a way for users to play or sing original pieces that are transcribed into sheet music in real time with the capability to edit and save. InTune is a great way for users to get into the world of music.
